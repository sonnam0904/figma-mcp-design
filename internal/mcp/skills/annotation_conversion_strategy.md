# Automatic Annotation Conversion
            
## Process Overview

The process of converting manual annotations (numbered/alphabetical indicators with connected descriptions) to Figma's native annotations:

1. Get selected frame/component information
2. Scan and collect all annotation text nodes
3. Scan target UI elements (components, instances, frames)
4. Match annotations to appropriate UI elements
5. Apply native Figma annotations

## Step 1: Get Selection and Initial Setup

First, get the selected frame or component that contains annotations:

```typescript
// Get the selected frame/component
const selection = await get_selection();
const selectedNodeId = selection[0].id

// Get available annotation categories for later use
const annotationData = await get_annotations({
  nodeId: selectedNodeId,
  includeCategories: true
});
const categories = annotationData.categories;
```

## Step 2: Scan Annotation Text Nodes

Scan all text nodes to identify annotations and their descriptions:

```typescript
// Get all text nodes in the selection
const textNodes = await scan_text_nodes({
  nodeId: selectedNodeId
});

// Filter and group annotation markers and descriptions

// Markers typically have these characteristics:
// - Short text content (usually single digit/letter)
// - Specific font styles (often bold)
// - Located in a container with "Marker" or "Dot" in the name
// - Have a clear naming pattern (e.g., "1", "2", "3" or "A", "B", "C")


// Identify description nodes
// Usually longer text nodes near markers or with matching numbers in path
  
```

## Step 3: Scan Target UI Elements

Get all potential target elements that annotations might refer to:

```typescript
// Scan for all UI elements that could be annotation targets
const targetNodes = await scan_nodes_by_types({
  nodeId: selectedNodeId,
  types: [
    "COMPONENT",
    "INSTANCE",
    "FRAME"
  ]
});
```

## Step 4: Match Annotations to Targets

Match each annotation to its target UI element using these strategies in order of priority:

1. **Path-Based Matching**:
   - Look at the marker's parent container name in the Figma layer hierarchy
   - Remove any "Marker:" or "Annotation:" prefixes from the parent name
   - Find UI elements that share the same parent name or have it in their path
   - This works well when markers are grouped with their target elements

2. **Name-Based Matching**:
   - Extract key terms from the annotation description
   - Look for UI elements whose names contain these key terms
   - Consider both exact matches and semantic similarities
   - Particularly effective for form fields, buttons, and labeled components

3. **Proximity-Based Matching** (fallback):
   - Calculate the center point of the marker
   - Find the closest UI element by measuring distances to element centers
   - Consider the marker's position relative to nearby elements
   - Use this method when other matching strategies fail

Additional Matching Considerations:
- Give higher priority to matches found through path-based matching
- Consider the type of UI element when evaluating matches
- Take into account the annotation's context and content
- Use a combination of strategies for more accurate matching

## Step 5: Apply Native Annotations

Convert matched annotations to Figma's native annotations using batch processing:

```typescript
// Prepare annotations array for batch processing
const annotationsToApply = Object.values(annotations).map(({ marker, description }) => {
  // Find target using multiple strategies
  const target = 
    findTargetByPath(marker, targetNodes) ||
    findTargetByName(description, targetNodes) ||
    findTargetByProximity(marker, targetNodes);
  
  if (target) {
    // Determine appropriate category based on content
    const category = determineCategory(description.characters, categories);

    // Determine appropriate additional annotationProperty based on content
    const annotationProperty = determineProperties(description.characters, target.type);
    
    return {
      nodeId: target.id,
      labelMarkdown: description.characters,
      categoryId: category.id,
      properties: annotationProperty
    };
  }
  return null;
}).filter(Boolean); // Remove null entries

// Apply annotations in batches using set_multiple_annotations
if (annotationsToApply.length > 0) {
  await set_multiple_annotations({
    nodeId: selectedNodeId,
    annotations: annotationsToApply
  });
}
```


This strategy focuses on practical implementation based on real-world usage patterns, emphasizing the importance of handling various UI elements as annotation targets, not just text nodes.
